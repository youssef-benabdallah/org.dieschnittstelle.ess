/*
 * note that beans that are used between services and the dependencies to which might either
 * be satisified by local implementation or by implementations that use a rest client need
 * to provide a local interface in addition to the remote one. This is mainly due to the following issues
 * - using a single interface with jax-rs annotations and @RegisterRestClient registration results
 * in an implementation ambiguity for monolithic deployments as the dynamically created rest client
 * implementation will be an a alternative to the 'real' implementation)
 * - disambiguation requires introduction of a custom CDI qualifier
 * - usage of the qualifier at the level of the implementation class as a class level identifier results,
 * for whatever reason, in interceptors not being considered anymore if the bean is accessed as a rest resource
 * implementation. In particular, this completely breaks transactionality via @Transactional for these cases
 *
 * The problem both occurs on monolithic wildfly and tomee deployments, but CDI troubleshooting did not reveal any particular solutions to overcome the issue.
 * Usage of two different interfaces helps as ambiguity does not occur, then. One could check whether usage of a producer, like for the entity manager, could help, as well.
 * It would also be nice if @RegisterRestClient could be dealt with at the level of config files
 * rather than by annotation only as usage of it requires additional setup for wildfly in spite of the
 * fact that we do not need it here... well, it is only necessary to require the microprofile-config layer
